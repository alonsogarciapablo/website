# The challenge

In the project I‚Äôm working on, we recently had to replace some Vue.js components from a third-party library ([Keen UI](https://josephuspaye.github.io/Keen-UI/#/ui-alert)) with our own components. Our goal was to unify the look and feel of all the form fields (eg: textboxes, selects, etc.) in our web app.

We used these components extensively across the codebase, so this was quite an undertaking, especially considering that **the APIs of the old and the new components were different** üòÖ.

One of the requirements for this project was that **all of the old components had to be replaced at once**. We couldn‚Äôt first work on the selects, then textboxes, etc. It had to be released all at once to keep the UI consistent at all times.

## An example

Let‚Äôs use a super simple example to illustrate the kind of challenge we‚Äôre faced with.

Imagine you have an `OldButton` Vue.js component and you have to replace it by a `NewButton` component, all across your codebase.

`OldButton` has a `label` prop and emits a `click` event:

```vue
<!-- OldButton.vue -->
<template>
  <button @click="$emit('click')">{{ label }}</button>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: "OldButton",
    props: {
      label: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
      },
    },
  };
</script>
```

`NewButton` has a `text` prop and emits a `pressed` event:

```vue
<!-- NewButton.vue -->
<template>
  <button @click="$emit('pressed')">{{ text }}</button>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: "NewButton",
    props: {
      text: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
      },
    },
  };
</script>
```

So, your goal is to go from:

```html
<OldButton :label="label" @click="handleClick" />
```

To:

```html
<NewButton :text="text" @pressed="handleClick" />
```

I invite you to pause here for a second and think‚Ä¶ how would I approach this
kind of problem?

# Our approach: the feature branch Marathon

Our approach looked easy and simple at first:

- Create a feature branch
- For each kind of old component to be replaced:
  - While there are still instances of the old
    component, do:
    - Find an instance of the old component
    - Replace it with the new component
  - Delete the old components
  - Merge the feature branch and celebrate ü•Ç

To make our lives easier, **we created a migration guide**. For each
component that had to be replaced, we outlined the differences and changes that
had to be done to migrate it to the new component.

Since we had to release everything at once, **we created a feature branch**,
and off **we went to replace components one by one on the feature branch**!

{% include figure popup=false image_path="assets/images/posts/replacing-components-with-different-apis/coding.gif" alt="A person coding" caption="This is how fast we thought we would do this" %}

6 months later‚Ä¶ The feature branch was still alive! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

With nobody really
working on this initiative full-time, this branch ended up staying open for 6
months!

During that time:

- The feature branch had to always be updated with
  `main`, resolving merge conflicts along the way.
- Since new developments were using the old components, every time we merged `main` into the feature branch,
  we had to replace those new usages, too.

**This approach turned out to be pretty slow and painful**. It was a Marathon!

## This approach in action

Coming back to our simple example, this approach would look like this:

{% include figure popup=true image_path="assets/images/posts/replacing-components-with-different-apis/our-approach.png" alt="Diagram of our approach" caption="Our approach" %}

Basically, you have to change:

```html
<OldButton :label="label" @click="handleClick" />
```

With:

```html
<NewButton :text="label" @pressed="handleClick" />
```

Now, imagine having to do this in a large code base with multiple types of more
complex components.

# A better alternative: using Adapters

After having finally
pushed and completed this initiative, I started wondering: how could have done
it differently to make it less painful?

**One alternative could have be been to
take advantage of the [Adapter
pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern)**:

> the adapter pattern
> is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to
> be used as another interface.It is often used to make existing classes work with
> others without modifying their source code.

Here‚Äôs the canonical example of an adapter in the real world:

{% include figure popup=false image_path="assets/images/posts/replacing-components-with-different-apis/power-adapter.jpeg" alt="A Power Adapter" caption="A Power Adapter" %}

> A power adapter allows a device designed for one type of socket to be used with
> a different type of socket

Instead of jumping straight right in and changing all
the instances of the old component with the new one in a feature branch (like we
did), you can follow this **alternative approach using adapters**:

- For each kind of old component to be replaced:
  - Create an adapter component.
- Create a feature branch
  - While there are still instances of the old component, do:
    - Replace it with the adapter component
  - Merge the feature branch (optionally: you can celebrate at this point ü•Ç)
- Delete the old components.
- While there are still instances of the adapter components, do:
  - Replace it with the new
    component
- Delete the adapter components.

## This approach in action

For our
simple example, this alternative approach would look like this:

{% include figure popup=true image_path="assets/images/posts/replacing-components-with-different-apis/new-approach.png" alt="Diagram of a better alternative" caption="A better alternative" %}

We first create the adapter component. Let‚Äôs call it `OldButtonToNewButtonAdapter`:

```vue
<!-- OldButtonToNewButtonAdapter.vue -->
<template>
  <NewButton :text="label" @pressed="$emit('click')" />
</template>

<script>
  import NewButton from "./NewButton.vue";

  export default {
    name: "OldButtonToNewButtonAdapter",
    components: { NewButton },
    props: {
      label: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
      },
    },
  };
</script>
```

This new component provides the same API of the `OldButton(`receives a `label`
prop and emits a `click` event), but internally uses the `NewButton`. This
allows us to easily replace the instances of the old component:

```html
<OldButton :label="label" @click="handleClick" />
```

With the adapter component:

```html
<OldButtonToNewButtonAdapter :label="label" @click="handleClick" />
```

**Replacing the old component with the new adapter component should be fairly
easy and straigforward** (almost a find and replace) and, **at this point we
could say that our goal is completed**: the UI is using the `NewButton!` ü™Ñ

Also, we can get rid of the `OldButton` component, since it‚Äôs no longer being
used.

And now, we can **iteratively** replace usages of
`OldButtonToNewButtonAdapter` component by the `NewButton` component. From:

```html
<OldButtonToNewButtonAdapter :label="label" @click="handleClick" />
```

To:

```html
<NewButton :text="label" @pressed="handleClick" />
```

Finally, once the `OldButtonToNewButtonAdapter` is no longer being used, we can
safely delete it and our job would be fully completed!

## Combining adapters with feature flags

Additionally, we could have combined Adapters with feature
flags to have more control over when / where to switch on/off the new
components. This would allow us to, for example, turn on the new components in a
test environment to verify they worked correctly.

```vue
<!-- OldButtonToNewButtonAdapter.vue -->
<template>
  <NewButton v-if="useNewButton" :text="label" @pressed="$emit('click')" />
  <OldButton v-else :label="label" @click="$emit('click')" />
</template>

<script>
  import NewButton from "./NewButton.vue";

  export default {
    name: "OldButtonToNewButtonAdapter",
    components: { NewButton },
    props: {
      label: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
      },
    },
    setup: function () {
      const { useNewButton } = useFeatureFlags();

      return {
        useNewButton,
      };
    },
  };
</script>
```

# Conclusion

Replacing components, wether they‚Äôre frontend components, classes,
or functions, with others that provide a different API can challenging,
especially in a large and evolving codebase.

In my experience, **using a feature branch and replacing components one by one turned out to be painful and slow**.

Next time, I will definitely consider using the Adapter Pattern to ease the
migration.
